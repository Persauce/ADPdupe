# ADPdupe
Remake of ADP's implementation of a sign in kiosk using face recognition.
                                                          To Do
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
DEMO
- Find a way to freeze it when it finds a face and then prompt the ui with the clocked in screen. 
- so basically do like a 2 second counter and if majority of it is a certain name then pause it until a certain variable says to continue running??>?>>>>?????



- Take the name that the algorithm finds from the face after matching with the dataset and use it to clock into ADP using TimeCard API
- Make cases for when employee is clocked in/clocked out, does not exist, etc.
- Develop a UI to do possibly implement 2 different ways:
    1. Display employee name with the window of the live camera and show either clocked in/clocked out when they show face
    2. Display the employee now has the power to either click clock in or clock out
