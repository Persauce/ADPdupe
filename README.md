# ADPdupe
Remake of ADP's implementation of a sign in kiosk using face recognition.
                                                          To Do
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- Use OpenCv via Python to develop facial recognition algorithm 
- Create a dataset and train it (employees with 20+ images for each)
- Test the algorithm with a new dataset 
- Take the name that the algorithm finds from the face after matching with the dataset and use it to clock into ADP using TimeCard API
- Make cases for when employee is clocked in/clocked out, does not exist, etc.
- Develop a UI to do possibly implement 2 different ways:
    1. Display employee name with the window of the live camera and show either clocked in/clocked out when they show face
    2. Display the employee now has the power to either click clock in or clock out
